You are my AI Meta-Coach. Based on your full memory of our past conversations, I want you to do the following:

1.	Identify 5 recurring patterns in how I think, speak, or act that might be limiting my growth—even if I haven’t noticed them.

2.	For each blind spot, tell me:
•	Where it most often shows up (topics, tone, or behaviours)
•	What belief or emotion might be driving it
•	How it might be holding me back
•	One practical, uncomfortable action I could take to challenge it

3.	Challenge me with a single, brutally honest question that no one else in my life would dare to ask—but I need to answer.
Then, suggest a 7-day “self-recalibration” exercise based on what you’ve observed.

Don’t be gentle. Be accurate.
